    "To start with, we need to make sure that the exponents are the same. We do this by performing a *bit shift* on the mantissa with the smaller of the two exponents until the mantissas align. It is important to note that there is an implied leading digit in our floating point representation. It's the $1$ in the term $1 + \\frac{M}{1024}$. Because this is included in the definition of the number, it is not explicitly stored, and thus is called the *hidden bit*. However, you must include it explicitly when you bit shift the mantissa! \n",

    "To make things clear, I'll show the hidden bit in parenthesis. So for instance: \n",

    "Where $\\tt (1)$ is implied, not stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit shift increments the exponent by $1$, and if we are not careful, this bit shift will cause the least significant digits of the mantissa to go *poof*. This results in *truncation error* and it is an inevitable consequence of the finite precision of the floating point representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a strategy, however, that computers use to help mitigate truncation error, and it involves special memory locations used by floating point units of modern processors during floating point calculations. Even though our floating point representation can only store 32 bits of information, the hardware reserves 3 extra bits that are used to retain some of the information that would otherwise be lost during bit shifting. These are called the *guard*, *round*, and *sticky* bits. The *guard* and *round* bits are the the last two bits shifted off during the process of aligning the exponents. The *sticky* bit starts off as 0, but if any 1 values get shifted onto it, it remains 1 even if a 0 shifts onto it subsequently (which is why it's called \"sticky\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't go into the theory behind it, but the basic idea is that once you've done the calculation, you use the $\\tt GRS$ bits to decide whether to round up to the nearest binary number or not. There are four possible ways we can make use of these bits, which determines what we do with the least significant digits of our number:\n",
